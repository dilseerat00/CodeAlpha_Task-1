# CodeAlpha_Task-1

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates two functionalities:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator:** A Python program to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.
2. **Voice Assistant:** A Python-based voice assistant capable of performing basic tasks like telling the time, setting reminders, and opening applications based on voice commands.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This task involves creating a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit. The program will output a list of Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0 and 1.

**Steps to complete:**
1. Create a function to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given number `n`.
2. The program will take an input value for `n` and print the Fibonacci sequence.
3. The sequence will be generated using an iterative method for better performance.

### Task 2: Voice Assistant

The second part of this project is building a basic voice assistant using Python. The assistant will respond to voice commands such as telling the current time, setting reminders, and performing simple tasks like opening applications.

**Steps to complete:**
1. Install required libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and basic tasks:
    - `SpeechRecognition` (for speech-to-text)
    - `pyttsx3` (for text-to-speech)
    - `datetime` (for current time)
    - `os` (for opening applications)
    - `wikipedia` (for retrieving information)
   
2. Implement functions to:
   - Recognize voice commands.
   - Convert speech to text.
   - Use text-to-speech to respond to commands.

## Technologies Used

1. **Python** - The programming language used for both tasks.
2. **Libraries:**
   - `SpeechRecognition` - For recognizing speech.
   - `pyttsx3` - For text-to-speech functionality.
   - `datetime` - For getting the current date and time.
   - `os` - For opening applications and files.
   - `wikipedia` - For fetching information from Wikipedia.

## Installation

To run these scripts, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries. Use the following steps to set up the project:

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fibonacci-voice-assistant.git
   cd fibonacci-voice-assistant
```
